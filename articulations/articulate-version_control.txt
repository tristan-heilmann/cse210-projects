What is version control and why is it important?

- Explain the meaning of Version Control
    Version Control is a system called "Version Control System" - or VCS for
short - that monitors and tracks the history of changes that people/teams make in a collaborative
project. Those who make these changes are called developers, as they develop the project, which
can also be called a program.

- Highlight a benefit of Version Control
    Each change creates a new "version" of the project that the developers can recover and return
to at any time if they so choose. In doing so they can see which changes were made, who made
them, when they were made, and why they were needed. This unified, consistent view of the project
and transparent change history allows the developers to stay aligned with each other despite
working independently.

- Provide an application of Version Control. This means, provide an example of how Version
Control could be used
    Say you have three different developers, with one living in the US, one living in England,
and one living in Russia. The project is online so all three can access it, but due to the
varying time zones it's often difficult for all three to be working on the project at the same,
which makes real-time communication difficult. To get around this issue one incoperates a VCS
into the project, allowing them to see what the other two have been up to. This proves to be so
effective that they share it with the others, and now that they can see exactly what each other
have done progress is now smoother than ever.

- Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command)
    git commit -m
    This Version Control command - specifically for Git - takes any new changes made to the
program in the Github directory and commits them, making the program recieve the changes
globally.

- Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)
    Altogether there are over three hundred words in this file.
