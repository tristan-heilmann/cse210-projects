Abstraction sounds complicated on paper - or at least it did to me - but in practice it's extremely simple. Abstraction is the process of taking a function and removing the
redundancies and non-essential lines of code, "trimming the fat" so to speak and effectively simplifying the function. One of the benefits of abstraction is that smaller functions
are easier to use and don't need as much maintnence when something else in the code changes. A good example of this is one I actually used myself: I was making a list for the
prompt generator and originally I had this massive chunk of code that creates the five different prompts and then manually puts them in the list, but then after a bit of
experimenting I discovered that instead I can simply put them into the list directly using curly braces, rendering over a dozen lines of code unnecessary and consideribly trimming
down the file size.
