The definition of inheritance is to inherit something, which in turn means to recieve or be left with something from a previous owner. Usually the way one inherits something is
when the previous owner dies. Inheritance in coding is similar, but thankfully doesn't involve anything dying. The way inheritance works in programming is you have a file called a
"parent" file, and one or more "child" files who's classes are directly connected to the parent (as an example from my own code: public class ListingActivity : Activity). The
benefit of doing this is that child classes don't need to define the variables of their parent class, as through the inheritance they already have access to them. An application
of this would be to use a specific variable from a parent class in an equation in a different class, without needing to define the parent function and instead simply slapping it
in there.
